Project Background : The "Meals On Wheels" project aims to meet the needs of eligible adults who cannot cook for themselves due to age, illness, or disability. MerryMeal, a nonprofit, has teamed with food service companies nationwide to deliver hot lunches to members' homes efficiently. In addition, frozen meals are offered to members on weekends and outside of a 10-kilometer range from contracted cooks. As a full-stack web developer at Unity One Solutions, we have been assigned to design and create a software solution for this project.

Project Scope : System Overview - The application will have the following functionality:

1.       Members and Caregivers registration with their requirements
